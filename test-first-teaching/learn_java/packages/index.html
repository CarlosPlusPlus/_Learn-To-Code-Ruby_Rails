    <p>
    This lab is very straightforward.  We need to create two classes,
    both named Comment. (One speaks English, and one German.)
    How do we keep the names straight?  Packages!
    </p>

    <p>
    Remember when dealing with packages that you should run all your tools
    (javac etc.) from the <b>root</b>
    directory -- <b>not</b> the sub-directory that actually contains the source files.
    See <a href="http://www.purpletech.com/articles">Learn Java Packages In 21 Seconds</a>
    for "The Rules."
    </p>

    <p>
    (Also, please note that using packages is not the best way to
    handle Localization or Internationalization of your application.)
