    <h1>Java GUI with Swing</h1>

<p>

In this exercise we will create a simple Calculator GUI using Swing.
Here is a screen shot:

It is difficult to write tests for a GUI.  Here we will test as many
aspects of the GUI as we can "on the inside" -- for example, we will
test that when you click the "Add" button, the correct sum is
placed inside the "Result" text field -- but we will not try to make
sure that the buttons and fields are visible, or "look good".

<p>
To view the panel yourself, give your CalculatorPanel a main() method:

<pre>
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		JPanel p = new CalculatorPanel();
		JFrame f = new JFrame();
		f.getContentPane().add(p);
		f.setSize(350,200);
		f.setVisible(true);
	}
</pre>

<h2>CalculatorTest</h2>

<b>testIsJPanel</b> First, we must create an object named CalculatorPanel that is
a (extends) JPanel.

<p>
<b>testTextWidgets</b> Next, we give it three text fields (x, y, and answer).
This test merely checks that the fields exist.

<p>
<b>testButtonWidget</b> Likewise, this test checks that the getAddButton
method returns some button.

<p>
<b>testAdd</b> This tests the functional heart of our calculator.  To make
it pass, you must assure that when the add button is clicked, the correct
value is placed in the answer field.  (Pay attention to converting between
Strings and ints!)

<p>
<b>testError</b> Let's add some error checking!  If there are illegal parameters
in one of the text fields, it should display the string "error" in the answer
field.

<p>
<b>testLayout</b> merely asserts that the panel has a FlowLayout as its Layout
Manager.

<h2>SwingMultiplyTest*</h2>
<p>
<b>testMultiply</b> Extra credit!  Add a "Multiply" button and make it work.

<b></b>
