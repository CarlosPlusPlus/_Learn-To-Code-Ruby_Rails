What to do:
Write a spec that tests whether index.txt contains a list of all text files in this folder, excluding this READ_ME.txt file and the index.txt file itself.  If you want to be really fancy, try formatting the index file so that chapters are printed in title case without any underscores or ".txt". Also try printing out the numbers as words instead of integers.  If you want to be really, really fancy, try breaking the chapters into "Part 1", "Part 2" and "Part 3" as they are in the Well Grounded Rubyist's index page.

Write some code to make your spec pass in a separate file.
