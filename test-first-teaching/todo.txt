give generated site a Gemfile - DONE

have the standard rake task 'gem install rspec' if necessary (or at least check for it)

create course repo on github if it doesn't already exist, using github gem

http://marakana.com/forums/ruby/ruby_on_rails/191.html

allow subdirectories inside labs

substitute actual course repo git url in index.html

build solutions repo or zip or something, to allow students to see solutions after they've tried

If there are any failing tests, don't show any pending tests

Chris Pine doesn't do arrays for a while -- must sync better

table of contents (intra-page) in generated html pages

clicking on a file (esp. a .rb file) should show it, not download it

put tarball into git and link to it on github (to prevent out-of-sync issues)

* look into rubyspec and Speccify

* return elapsed time

* UI
  * "hide" X button for toggleable panels
  * icons in buttons
  * spinny during ajax request

* get SAFE=3 working again
  * current problem: using RSpec's stub method (Time.stub(:now)) from inside a SAFE block replaces it with an unsafe version of the method so you can't call it even once the SAFE thread exits. And this causes Rack::CommonLogger to raise an exception (when it calls Time.now) which breaks the entire web server. Ugh.
