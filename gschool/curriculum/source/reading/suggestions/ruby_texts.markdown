#### Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356360/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356360&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

This is a good choice for people who are struggling with the fundamentals of Ruby syntax and want to review things starting from scratch.

#### Dave Thomas' [Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937785491/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1937785491&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

This is a good choice for people who are feeling functional with the basics, but would like a bit more depth and breadth. This book is written in two parts, you'd focus on the front half which is a tutorial. The back half is more of a reference.

#### Russ Olsen's [Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If Ruby syntax is comfortable and you want to understand the _style_ behind writing good Ruby, this book is for you. Every student should read it at some point during our class.

#### Andy Hunt's [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356050/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356050&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you'd like something less technical, this book is rich with ideas about how to learn effectively -- especially as a developer.
